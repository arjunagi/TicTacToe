### Tic-Tac-Toe

The game is set up against the computer. The user selects the character to represent himself and the computer.  
The user makes the first move by selecting a number of the square from the board set-up below:

```
| 1 | 2 | 3
------------
| 4 | 5 | 6
------------
| 7 | 8 | 9
```

Next, the computer selects another square RANDOMLY from the list of available squares.  
The board will look like this if the user(X) selected 1, the computer(O) selected 5 and then the user(X) selected 9:
```
| X | - | -
------------
| - | O | -
------------
| - | - | X
```

The game continues until there is a winner or it is a draw (all squares are filled).
